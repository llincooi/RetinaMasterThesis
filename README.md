# Introduction 簡介
This repository contain important code used in my master thesis: *"Information Synergy Contributed to Anticipatory Dynamics in Retina"*. Most of the codes herein are written by me.<br>
In my study, activities of RGC were recorded in \*.mcd files, which then were converted into MATLAB files. Some basic analysis were also done using MATLAB. I used Python (and Jupyter Notebook) to analyze the experimental data and in simulation. However, in this repository, only code in Python were included.<br>
此資料庫為我的碩論--*「資訊協同對視網膜預測能力的貢獻」*--研究中主要所使用到的程式碼。多數程式碼皆為本人所寫。研究中，MATLAB用於訊號的處理與一些基礎的分析，Python用於分析與模擬，此資料庫僅包含python程式碼。
